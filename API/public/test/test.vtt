00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.600
This is the story of Bridget and Annie,
who share a flat in London,

2
00:00:18.639 --> 00:00:21.639
and the boys next door,
Nick and his friend Hector from Argentina.

3
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.478
Hector and Annie were in love,

4
00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:29.479
but now things are not so good.

5
00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:32.079
Bridget has given up on love,

6
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.080
And Nick -  well, his mum loves him!

7
00:00:35.599 --> 00:00:38.599
Stand by for Extra!

8
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.438
Hector.

9
00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.439
-  Yes?
-  Please could you pass the salt?

10
00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.079
Yes.

11
00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.399
Hector.

12
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.638
Yes?

13
00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:33.639
Please could you pass the pepper?

14
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.960
Of course.

15
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.278
Hector.

16
00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:49.279
Let me guess.
Can I pass the sugar, coffee, tea?

17
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.920
Actually, I was going to say we should talk.

18
00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:56.639
So, now you want to talk to me!

19
00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:59.399
It's only been a week!

20
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.400
-  I was hurt!
-  Well, you hurt me too.

21
00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:05.959
-  I didn't go out with Eunice!
-  I didn't go out with Eunice!

22
00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.119
Yes, you did! And you stayed out
till three o'clock in the morning!

23
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.478
There were other people there, too.

24
00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:20.479
-  Who?
-  People who work on the programme.

25
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.200
You mean other women
who work on the programme.

26
00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.478
Yes, and men -  why not, huh?

27
00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:29.519
I knew it!

28
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.079
So, who is she?

29
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.758
-  Who?
-  The other woman.

30
00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:37.239
There is no other woman!

31
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.240
Huh!

32
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.360
Annie, listen.

33
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.679
Excuse me.

34
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.680
Hello. Hi, Debbie.

35
00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:56.119
How are you? Good.

36
00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.520
OK, that'll be OK. Perfect! See you then.

37
00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:03.958
Bye.

38
00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.879
So, was that her?

39
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.880
-  Who?
-  Debbie. The other woman!

40
00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.079
That was Debbie from the make- up department,
confirming my call time for tomorrow.

41
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.680
Some excuse!

42
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.398
-  Hector.
-  Yes.

43
00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:30.399
Please could you pass me your fork?

44
00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.639
Here, I'm going.

45
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.640
You can have my dinner!

46
00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.879
You should have seen Eunice's face!

47
00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:08.079
She was furious!

48
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.080
When Eunice gets angry,
she is a very scary lady!

49
00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.239
Hello.

50
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.678
Yes.

51
00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:25.679
Excuse me. No, no, to her...

52
00:04:27.239 --> 00:04:30.239
Bye, Bridget.

53
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.320
All right, Hector. Bye.

54
00:04:33.359 --> 00:04:36.359
Hola, Lola!

55
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.440
-  Guess what?
-  Prince William wants to marry you?

56
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.480
I know that! No, I've got a promotion!

57
00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:54.278
That's nice.

58
00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:55.998
Nice? Nice!

59
00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:58.999
It's fantastic! I am editor of Channel 9 Live!

60
00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:04.399
Eunice is no longer my boss!

61
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.078
Is that Hugh Grant?

62
00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:13.079
It's Bridget Evans here.
Call me Gigi, editor of Channel 9 Live.

63
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.280
Are we still on for lunch at Claridge's today?

64
00:05:20.239 --> 00:05:23.239
Fab! Ciao!

65
00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:26.038
Eunice is so jealous!

66
00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.039
Now, that is good news.

67
00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.639
Annie, what are you doing?

68
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.678
I'm doing my own editing.

69
00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:37.679
Why are you cutting up
photos of you and Hector?

70
00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:40.999
Because Hector is no longer my boyfriend.

71
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.798
Really?

72
00:05:43.799 --> 00:05:45.839
Why?

73
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.840
Because he is having an affair!

74
00:05:50.239 --> 00:05:53.239
Really?! Who with?

75
00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:56.599
Well, I thought it was Eunice,
but now I think it's Debbie.

76
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.800
Well, I just heard him on the phone to Lola.

77
00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:06.279
Lola? Who's she?

78
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.400
Ha! Eunice, Debbie, Lola!

79
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.760
He's women mad!

80
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.038
It's fantastic!

81
00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:37.039
I am editor of Channel 9 Live!

82
00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:49.319
Hola, Lola!

83
00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:03.918
I didn't go out with Eunice!

84
00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:06.919
Yes, you did! And you stayed out
till three o'clock in the morning!

85
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.319
So, was that her?

86
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.320
-  Who?
-  Debbie. The other woman!

87
00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:37.039
Hi, Nick.

88
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.438
What are you doing?

89
00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:44.439
I am not doing, I am being.

90
00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.719
What are you being?

91
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.720
-  Can't you guess?
-  A man on the toilet?

92
00:07:53.679 --> 00:07:56.679
A Sumo wrestler?

93
00:07:57.479 --> 00:08:00.479
Can't you see? I am an egg.

94
00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:06.039
Of course, you are an egg.

95
00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:09.479
Now, what sort of egg am I?

96
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.079
Hard- boiled.

97
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.999
-  Scrambled.
-  Scrambled?

98
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
-  Fried.
-  Nearly!

99
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.759
Poached!

100
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.760
Yeah, of course. You are a poached egg.

101
00:08:24.519 --> 00:08:26.318
Yeah.

102
00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:29.319
Well, you're making a mess on your bed!

103
00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:33.479
Anyway, why are you being a poached egg?

104
00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:36.959
It's my new acting class.

105
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.960
Total Being.

106
00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:43.318
What are you next week? A piece of wood?

107
00:08:43.319 --> 00:08:46.319
-  A piece of wood?
-  Yeah! Then it would be wooden acting!

108
00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:53.159
Anyway, can poached eggs talk?

109
00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.118
Don't be silly! Of course poached eggs can't talk.

110
00:08:58.119 --> 00:08:59.958
No, no, I mean,

111
00:08:59.959 --> 00:09:02.959
when you are
'being' a poached egg, can you talk?

112
00:09:08.319 --> 00:09:10.958
Yeah.

113
00:09:10.959 --> 00:09:13.959
Anyway, I want to stop now,
my arms are hurting.

114
00:09:17.239 --> 00:09:20.198
So, what do you want to talk about?

115
00:09:20.199 --> 00:09:22.199
It is Annie.

116
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.919
She thinks I am having an affair.

117
00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.798
-  Who with?
-  Eunice.

118
00:09:27.799 --> 00:09:30.038
-  And Debbie.
-  What?

119
00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:32.399
Two women, Hector!

120
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.438
You cheeky thing!

121
00:09:34.439 --> 00:09:37.439
But I am not!

122
00:09:37.879 --> 00:09:40.879
-  So tell Annie then.
-  I have but she doesn't believe me.

123
00:09:41.639 --> 00:09:44.639
-  Why not?
-  I don't know.

124
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.200
Excuse me.

125
00:09:49.639 --> 00:09:52.639
Hola, Lola.

126
00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.678
I'll take this outside.

127
00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:57.879
How are you, Lola?

128
00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.880
So, it's not Eunice,
it's not Debbie, could it be - Lola?

129
00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:27.599
Stop, please!

130
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.519
I knew it!

131
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.519
It had to be a selfish man- driver!

132
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.359
Please, I have a voucher.

133
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.360
I- I am sorry, I've started, so I'll finish.

134
00:10:39.279 --> 00:10:42.279
Look, I am Zeus, why are you so angry?

135
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.880
I'm not. I am just doing my job - Zeus!

136
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.480
People park on yellow lines and then are
surprised when they get a parking ticket!

137
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.320
There was this one guy today -
'Please, I have a voucher.'

138
00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.438
No excuse!

139
00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:32.439
Mind you, he was quite cute.

140
00:11:36.919 --> 00:11:38.958
Nick.

141
00:11:38.959 --> 00:11:41.959
Nick, are you OK?

142
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.560
Bridget! Oh, it's you, Hector.

143
00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.998
Well, there's something wrong with Nick.

144
00:11:49.999 --> 00:11:52.999
-  Well, I could have told you that!
-  No, he won't speak, he won't move.

145
00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.080
I know. He is being a poached egg.

146
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
-  A what?
-  For his new acting class.

147
00:12:06.879 --> 00:12:08.919
Hi, Nick.

148
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.758
Let me guess.

149
00:12:10.759 --> 00:12:13.759
You are being - a potato.

150
00:12:15.599 --> 00:12:18.599
Do I look like a potato?

151
00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:21.839
Yes. A couch potato!

152
00:12:23.919 --> 00:12:26.118
What about a fish?

153
00:12:26.119 --> 00:12:29.119
Yes, a frozen fish!

154
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.759
I am not a fish.

155
00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.760
I...am...'Pain'.

156
00:12:36.799 --> 00:12:38.758
You are a pain.

157
00:12:38.759 --> 00:12:41.759
Yes, Nick is a pain!

158
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.240
No! I am 'Pain'.

159
00:12:45.959 --> 00:12:48.959
Hurt, agony.

160
00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:56.039
So, how was your first day as editor, Bridget?

161
00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.078
What a day!

162
00:12:59.079 --> 00:13:02.079
I had a very important meeting.
Big decisions to make.

163
00:13:02.959 --> 00:13:05.959
Like which celebrities,
new programme ideas?

164
00:13:08.359 --> 00:13:11.359
No, like which pen to use at my meeting?

165
00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.478
Blue, black...

166
00:13:14.479 --> 00:13:17.479
-  Which one did you choose?
-  Blue.

167
00:13:19.359 --> 00:13:21.519
Bad choice.

168
00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.520
You think so? Oh, no!

169
00:13:25.959 --> 00:13:28.959
Eunice is so jealous of Bridget's new job,
she won't talk to anyone!

170
00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.680
-  Not even you?
-  Not even me! It is great!

171
00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.840
You don't want her to talk to you?

172
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.398
-  Really?
-  Really!

173
00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:44.399
Oh, Annie, I hate it when we argue.

174
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.438
So do I.

175
00:13:47.439 --> 00:13:50.439
-  I miss you.
-  I miss...

176
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.160
Hola, Lola.

177
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.280
Right. Two can play that game.

178
00:14:26.759 --> 00:14:29.759
I am not doing, I am being.

179
00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.560
A man on the toilet?

180
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.280
Yeah!

181
00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.480
I am not a fish! I...am...'Pain'.

182
00:14:51.879 --> 00:14:54.879
It's not Eunice,
it's not Debbie, could it be -  Lola?

183
00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.480
Hola, Lola!

184
00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.400
Look, I am Zeus. Why are you so angry?

185
00:15:20.599 --> 00:15:23.599
I am just doing my job - Zeus!

186
00:15:45.079 --> 00:15:48.079
-  Hello again.
-  Hello.

187
00:15:48.199 --> 00:15:51.199
-  We meet again.
-  You're happier today.

188
00:15:51.799 --> 00:15:54.639
Yes, I am now!

189
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.479
But I'm sorry...

190
00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.480
I parked here, so you would come back.

191
00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.238
You wanted to see me again?

192
00:16:04.239 --> 00:16:07.239
You are so beautiful!

193
00:16:10.919 --> 00:16:13.919
Well, I'm sorry
but I am going to have to give you...

194
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.358
-  No...
-  This!

195
00:16:17.359 --> 00:16:19.159
My phone number.

196
00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.160
Call me.

197
00:16:22.439 --> 00:16:25.439
Who needs Hector?

198
00:16:34.719 --> 00:16:37.719
Hi, Bridget.

199
00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.518
What 'oh'?

200
00:16:53.519 --> 00:16:56.438
I know -  Superman!

201
00:16:56.439 --> 00:16:59.118
-  What?
-  I mean, Clark Kent.

202
00:16:59.119 --> 00:17:01.839
You are being Clark Kent, for your acting class.

203
00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.519
No. I'm not.

204
00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.520
I'm long- sighted.

205
00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.479
You're being long- sighted?

206
00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.518
No.

207
00:17:14.519 --> 00:17:16.598
I am long- sighted.

208
00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:19.599
I need to wear glasses for reading.

209
00:17:21.799 --> 00:17:24.799
They suit you.

210
00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.920
Thank you.
So, why are you not at Channel 9 today?

211
00:17:36.319 --> 00:17:39.319
I'm working from home today.

212
00:17:40.119 --> 00:17:42.878
I've so much to do!

213
00:17:42.879 --> 00:17:45.198
Bridget, what's the matter?

214
00:17:45.199 --> 00:17:48.199
I can't do it! Eunice hates me!

215
00:17:48.439 --> 00:17:50.399
Eunice hates everybody!

216
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.400
-  They all hate me!
-  No, they don't!

217
00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.720
-  They all look at me!
-  Bridget, you are their boss.

218
00:17:58.319 --> 00:18:01.319
I have to use the executive loo!

219
00:18:01.759 --> 00:18:03.799
What's the matter with that?

220
00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.800
I want to chat to all the girls!

221
00:18:07.799 --> 00:18:09.999
Bridget...

222
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
you are one of the cleverest,
most beautiful women I know.

223
00:18:17.479 --> 00:18:19.518
Really?

224
00:18:19.519 --> 00:18:22.519
-  Well, who are the others?
-  What do you mean?

225
00:18:23.119 --> 00:18:26.119
You said I was only one of the cleverest,
most beautiful girls you know.

226
00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.360
Bridget! You can do this job.

227
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.720
Channel 9 needs you.

228
00:18:41.239 --> 00:18:44.239
-  Thank you, Nick.
-  Hey, it was nothing.

229
00:18:46.519 --> 00:18:49.519
You really look handsome in those glasses.

230
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.438
Hi, Annie.

231
00:19:05.439 --> 00:19:07.518
Hi, Hector.

232
00:19:07.519 --> 00:19:10.519
-  You look smart.
-  Yes, I am going to meet someone.

233
00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:14.560
Annie, I have something to tell you.

234
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.519
Sorry.

235
00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.520
Lola!

236
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.600
Vale. Si, si, ya voy.

237
00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.640
Hasta luego.

238
00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.880
'Annie, I have something to tell you.'

239
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.600
That he is going on a date with Lola!
That's what!

240
00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.720
Nick, stop it! You're tickling me!

241
00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.719
Hi, Annie. I didn't hear you come in.

242
00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.720
Nick! Stop it!

243
00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.800
Is everybody happy, apart from me?

244
00:20:03.639 --> 00:20:06.639
Hello.

245
00:20:07.519 --> 00:20:10.038
Zeus! Hi!

246
00:20:10.039 --> 00:20:13.039
Well, of course I remember you!

247
00:20:15.719 --> 00:20:18.598
A drink? Tonight?

248
00:20:18.599 --> 00:20:21.599
Well, I'd love to.

249
00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.840
Stop it! You're tickling me!

250
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.720
Zeus, meet my friends, Bridget and Nick.

251
00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.360
-  Hi.
-  Hi.

252
00:21:07.119 --> 00:21:10.119
Well, hello, Zeus!

253
00:21:10.999 --> 00:21:13.758
Annie, where did you find him?

254
00:21:13.759 --> 00:21:16.759
Yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses,
though, does he?

255
00:21:22.119 --> 00:21:24.959
We've had a lovely evening, haven't we, Zeus?

256
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.079
Wonderful, Annie.

257
00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.319
Now I must say goodnight.

258
00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.320
Please, first may I use your bathroom?

259
00:21:33.839 --> 00:21:36.839
-  Certainly.
-  Thank you.

260
00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.080
Zeus is such a gentle man.

261
00:21:45.639 --> 00:21:48.639
He certainly is a man.

262
00:21:55.439 --> 00:21:58.439
Hi.

263
00:21:58.479 --> 00:22:01.479
Annie, I must talk to you.

264
00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.240
What about? Your date with Lola?

265
00:22:06.039 --> 00:22:08.758
My date with Lola?

266
00:22:08.759 --> 00:22:11.759
Annie, Lola is a 60- year- old
chief executive for ATV.

267
00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.400
-  What's ATV?
-  Argentinian Television.

268
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.158
And...

269
00:22:24.159 --> 00:22:27.159
She wants me to return to Argentina
to present their number one show.

270
00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.679
But I don't want to go.

271
00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.680
I want to stay here - with you.

272
00:22:48.199 --> 00:22:50.559
That's better.

273
00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.560
Hector, this is...

274
00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.880
Zeus, my new boyfriend.

275
00:22:57.959 --> 00:23:00.879
We've had a lovely evening, haven't we!

276
00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.880
Come on, I'll say goodbye to you downstairs!

277
00:23:11.199 --> 00:23:14.199
So, Hector, will you take the job?

278
00:23:17.839 --> 00:23:20.839
What do you think I should do, Annie?

279
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.080
So we must say goodbye
to our friends for now.

280
00:23:29.759 --> 00:23:32.759
Will Hector stay, or go back to Argentina?

281
00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:37.040
Will Annie go with him?

282
00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.400
And will Nick ever give up on Bridget?

283
00:23:41.039 --> 00:23:44.039
Extra - will the story continue?!

284
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:46.159
Extra - will the story continue?!
